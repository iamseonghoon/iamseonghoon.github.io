Hello, this is Seonghoon Park. Welcome to my website. üòÄ

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea. Also, I am a member of the [Mobile Embedded Systems Lab.](https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr) supervised by Prof. Hojung Cha.

My research interests include mobile web experiences and energy-aware mobile systems. I have published reseach papers in top-tier conferences including MobiCom, MobiSys, INFOCOM, and PerCom. You can find my [CV](/assets/pdf/seonghoon_cv.pdf) here!

If you'd like to contact me, please email me at [park.s@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:park.s@yonsei.ac.kr) (primary) or [park@seonghoon.email](mailto:park@seonghoon.email) (secondary). Thank you üôè
