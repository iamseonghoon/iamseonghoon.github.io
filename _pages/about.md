Hello, there. Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

This is Seonghoon Park. Just for your information, I'm called Park Seonghoon (ë°•ì„±í›ˆ) in Korea.

I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I am also a member of the [Mobile Embedded Systems Lab.](https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr) supervised by Prof. Hojung Cha. I received the B.S. degree in computer science from Yonsei University in February 2018.

My research interests include cross-device computing, on-device machine learning, energy-aware mobile systems, and mobile web. I have published several research papers in top conferences such as MobiCom, MobiSys, INFOCOM, and PerCom. My [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/740ng2zye30yc89/Seonghoon_CV.pdf) is available here!

If you'd like to contact me, please email me at [park.s@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:park.s@yonsei.ac.kr) (primary) or [park@seonghoon.email](mailto:park@seonghoon.email) (secondary).
